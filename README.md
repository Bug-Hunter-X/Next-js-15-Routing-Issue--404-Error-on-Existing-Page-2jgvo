# Next.js 15 Routing Issue: 404 Error on Existing Page

This repository demonstrates a Next.js 15 routing problem where a page (About) correctly defined within the `pages` directory returns a 404 error instead of the expected content.  The Home page functions as expected.

## Problem Description

A simple Next.js 15 application with two pages (`pages/index.js` and `pages/about.js`) fails to render the `/about` route.  Navigating to `/about` results in a 404 error page, even though the `about.js` file exists and contains a simple component.

## Solution

The solution is often related to file system issues, typos in the file name or path (case sensitivity), or incorrect routing configurations.  In this case, a simple fix resolves the problem.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (Home page renders correctly).
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/about` (404 error).

## Further Considerations

- Verify that the `about.js` file is saved correctly, and the file system is not in a corrupt state.
- Verify that there are no additional configurations such as custom routing interfering with the default behavior.
